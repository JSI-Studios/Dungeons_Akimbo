## Dungeons Akimbo
Dungeons Akimbo is an action packed top down 2D dungeon crawler shooter! You can play as
four different characters each with their own unique weapon in their main hand, and a pistol
in the offhand. Players progress through the game by killing all the enemies on each level
before moving onto the next level. Players can use a dodge mechanic to become immune to damage
for a brief instance of time and slightly increasing speed. Each weapon has its own unique attributes 
such as damage, fire rate, ammo size, and reload speed.

Each level provides a different action packed experience 
with different terrain and enemies! Boss levels are even more hectic and force players to adapt
their strategy! Collect gold and health potions from chests scattered throughout the map to
increase points or survivability.
